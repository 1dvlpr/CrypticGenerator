# Passw*rd Generator
This is the safest (the method of algorithm) password generator using crypto's random value instead of `Math.random()` as used by majority of services.

> Providing with the great UI and completely open source.

Don't worry, we will never save the passwords we generate nor store what you copy. The whole project is open sourced ðŸŽŠ
